Memphis Plume</a></h2>
<p>On a crisp morning in early December 2024, I was running by the
Mississippi when I noticed a plume on the horizon:</p>
<figure>
<img src="memphis-plume.jpg"
alt="A large industral plume over south Memphis." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A large industral plume over south
Memphis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At first, I thought it was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_(supercomputer)">xAI’s
“Colossus” supercomputer</a>. However, the plume is mostly from the
Tennessee Valley Authority’s Allen Combined Cycle Plant—a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Combined_Cycle_Plant">1.1-gigawatt
natural gas power plant powering Memphis</a>, which sits on the same
site. Nevertheless, let’s take it as a vision of the future that lies on
our current development path.</p>
<p>With 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, xAI is believed to be the world’s
largest AI supercomputer. It’s already drawing around 150 MW and
substantial cooling water. For now, that’s only a fraction of Allen’s
power footprint, but <a
href="https://www.cleanenergy.org/blog/will-memphis-pay-a-price-for-elon-musks-xai-colossus-bait-switch/">xAI’s
plans call for scaling to a gigawatt in the coming year</a>—potentially
creating its own towering plume of the same scale in the race toward
artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>This growing industrial footprint, now dominating Memphis’s skyline,
foreshadows compute’s heat waste made visible in our rush to train an
artificial general intelligence (AGI). <a
href="https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/musks-xais-colossus-cluster-set-for-one-million-gpu-supercomputer-expansion">xAI’s
stated goal is a “1% shot at a Kardashev type 1 civilization”</a>—a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_civilization">society
capable of harnessing all its planet’s energy</a>, presumably enabled by
the AGI they aim to bring into the world. And they’re just getting
started, with a tenfold <a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c0516cf-dd12-4665-aa22-712de854fe2f">expansion
of Colossus to 1M GPUs</a> already planned.</p>
<h2
id="universal-computation"><a name="universal-computation" href="#universal-computation">Universal
Computation</a></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that, although ravenous and hyperactive, a human
child doesn’t generate a thousand meter plume of water vapor and
reactive particulates to develop their intelligence. Yet your average
human, fueled by sandwiches, can implement any algorithm with just pen
and paper. So augmented with bronze age technology, we become <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230">“universal” computers in
Turing’s language</a>—the quintessential “general” intelligence capable
of solving any problem given enough time and snacks. For the sake of
argument, let’s agree: general intelligence ≈ universal computer.</p>
<p>That link has been on my mind for two years, ever since I first read
the magic words “Let’s think step by step” in a groundbreaking machine
learning paper. I was amused by how a simple phrase, <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916">first introduced in “Large
Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners”</a>, seemed to invoke a more
deliberate, thoughtful mode in large language models (LLMs). It was as
if some <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_psychological_effects">psychological
effect</a> flipped them into a more rigorous and structured part of
their state space, leading to dramatic improvement in performance, and
encouraging the world’s LLM whisperers to add this incantation to every
time they saw models faltering.</p>
<p>But theoretical analyses of transformers revealed something deeper
than just a neat psychology trick. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07923">Transformers, in a single
forward pass, are restricted to a computational class called TC0</a>,
basically a family of threshold circuits that can be computed in
parallel with aggregation. TC0 systems are often called “bounded
parallel”. They can quickly match patterns, but can’t count, do math, or
follow a recipe unless the process can be encoded in a fixed set of
circuits. <em>However</em>, if you use “chain-of-thought” or a series of
recursive prompts—feeding each of the model’s outputs back into its
input—<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15408">the combined system
becomes capable of simulating a universal Turing machine</a>. The
model’s expressivity, harnessed across multiple steps, blossoms into
general computation.</p>
<h2
id="memory-makes-computation-universal"><a name="memory-requirement" href="#memory-requirement">Memory
Makes Computation Universal</a></h2>
<p>Out of deep love for this line of research, I spent much of December
in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17794">a meditation on the link
between memory and computation</a>. There and in this post, I provide
the simplest and most intuitive explanation of universality (a.k.a.
general intelligence) that I could synthesize:</p>
<p><em>Universality requires only (1) stable evolution of thought (no
hallucinations), and (2) reliable access to the history of
thought.</em></p>
<p>This synthesis rightly seems banal, dull, too simple to be useful,
too theory of computation 101 to be interesting. And OK, if you studied
the theory of computation, yes, it is, but why did y’all forget the
textbook and start imaging that threshold circuits and feedforward
networks could achieve general intelligence? If you can remember, this
perspective quickly takes us to some amazing places.</p>
<p>The first place is an intuitive understanding of what LLMs are. <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Machine learning got excited by
the observation that adding more parameters and training tokens could
yield “scaling laws” that took us to a place where intelligence
“emerged”</a>. Another interpretation is that LLMs are a quintessential
example of transfer learning, where humans and our society is the model
that’s being transferred. By trying to predict what humans might say or
do next, the models effectively learned patterns embedded in our
writing—including the latent computational rules that shape human
reasoning. They’re not just modeling words but the programs behind those
words (which might be human minds, or other models, or entire
cryptographic protocols). Looking through the lens of Turing machines,
we’ve transferred our state transition functions to them, which they are
now they are able to generalize to new input contexts (<a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">drawing tikz unicorns and
such</a>). This deeper transfer of computational thinking <a
href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/">explains why models
continue improving far beyond naive pattern-matching saturation
points</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783">technical
paper</a>)—they’re gradually refining their models of human cognitive
processes themselves.</p>
<p>Part of the magic is that LLMs, most of which are Transformers, are
forging a shared computational interface with us, letting us push each
other around in a collaborative workspace space that can solve new
tasks.</p>
<h2 id="the-bitter-pill"><a name="bitter-pill" href="#bitter-pill">The
Bitter Pill</a></h2>
<p>However, they have a costly flaw that makes them otherworldly in
their resource demands: attention. In effect, attention is a learned
function for memory and association across the input. But with
<em>n</em> tokens, each must attend to every other token—an <em>n</em> ×
<em>n</em> explosion in both compute and memory. Double your context
length, quadruple the cost. Want to “think” four times longer? That’s
sixteen times more overhead. And because memory is the key to
intelligence, model context length must be increased, leading to
quadratic increases in costs. Attention demonstrates <a
href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">the
bitter lesson</a>: end-to-end learning beats architecture, but it also
forces us to eat a <em>bitter pill</em>: a quadratic cost that we can’t
scale forever. A transformer’s quadratic scaling hits a wall from 100k
to 1M tokens. It’s no coincidence that this is precisely the range of
maximum context lengths seen in current frontier models.</p>

scale.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2
id="natures-solution"><a name="natures-solution" href="#natures-solution">Nature’s
Solution</a></h2>
<p>But the truth is, generality doesn’t require a quadratic cost. Look
at a single cell. It has gigabases of DNA and a swarm of biomolecules,
operating in a parallel soup with no centralizing control. By some
definitions, each cell’s molecular interactions also fall in that
threshold-circuit-like class: essentially parallel transformations, no
large sequential pipeline. But cells offset this limitation with
state—encoded in their components and their DNA, which holds a record of
life’s entire lineage. When cells need to store or recall specific bits
of information, they literally write it into the genome. The canonical
example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</a>. At
its core, CRISPR functions as a chronological log of viral
fragments—essentially addresses in DNA space. These fragments represent
viral infections that both the individual cell and its ancestral lineage
have survived. The chronology is not just an artifact of the system, but
is essential because by remembering which viruses are more recent, the
cell can invest more energy in making guided nucleases that target them
than ones which occurred long ago.</p>

alt="CRISPR, better known for its use as a genome editing tool, is actually a temporal memory system." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">CRISPR, better known for its use as a

</figure>
<p>The ARC AGI Prize nicely illustrates where today’s models stand. A
single forward-pass language model—like GPT-4—gets about 0–5% accuracy
on ARC tasks. Cheaper chain-of-thought–based systems that do a bit of <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07279">test-time training</a> <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04604">get close to 50%</a>. Meanwhile,
a careful human solver will approach 100% if you just give them enough
time to think.</p>
<h2
id="beyond-brute-force"><a name="beyond-brute-force" href="#beyond-brute-force">Beyond
Brute Force</a></h2>
<p>Then, in late December 2024, along comes <a
href="https://openai.com/index/deliberative-alignment/">OpenAI’s o3</a>,
which <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough">nearly
solved the entire benchmark</a>. If you let the model “think less”—what
they call high-efficiency mode—it answers 400 tasks at 82.8% accuracy
for around $6,600. But if you let it think 172 times longer, exploring
many more possible solution paths in parallel, it climbs to 91.5%. That
final push costs an estimated $1.15 million (≈ 172 × $6.6k) in total
compute. <a href="https://openai.com/index/deliberative-alignment/">o3’s
authors describe this not primarily as an engineering hack but as an
ethical one</a>, “deliberative alignment” wherein an overseer system
that maintains the alignment of an kind of “forest of thought”, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">MCMC</a>
sampled chains-of-thought which are kept in check. Their published
numbers suggest that they pay a monstrous cost to keep all those partial
reasoning traces in memory, to preserve consistency, and let the model
think longer in pursuit of another apparent scaling law.</p>
<p>In effect, by brute-forcing memory into reliability, they show how
easily you can approach universal computation if you’re willing to burn
a fortune on tokens. And this isn’t like previous scaling laws that
revealed new capabilities—it’s paying an enormous price to achieve
something that biological systems do routinely. To reach the kind of
sustained reliable thinking needed for real breakthroughs—novel cancer
treatments, scientific discoveries, fundamental insights—we’d need to
maintain computational state not just for a few more steps, but across
weeks or months of focused investigation. Not just in one mind, but
across communities of thinkers building on each other’s work. At
quadratic cost, that’s not just unsustainable it’s impossible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, human civilization achieves this kind of extended
cognition through more elegant means. Ideas evolve across conversations,
papers, and experiments, maintaining state through distributed networks
of sandwich-powered minds working in shared contexts.</p>
<p>Current AI research has thus discovered that “thinking longer” helps,
but in their excitement over this empirical finding, many miss that
reliable memory is the fundamental capability that makes computation
universal. The field has <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPluSXJpdrA">embraced
psychological concepts like Daniel Kahneman “System 1” (fast, intuitive)
versus “System 2” (slow, deliberate) thinking to explain these
improvements</a>. o1/o3’s developers advocate <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaAonE58sLU">dramatically scaling
test-time compute</a> to “hours, days, even weeks”, but I truly wonder
how quadratic-memory transformer-based architectures will allow this to
happen.</p>
<p>Soon after <a
href="https://openai.com/index/deliberative-alignment/">o3’s
release</a>, OpenAI’s Board said that to achieve AGI, we’ll just need
(<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/openai_unimaginable">as
paraphrased</a>) “unimaginable sums of money”, <a
href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">proposing
to restructure as a public benefit corporation to attract fresh
capital</a>. They plan to scale up, spin more GPUs, and chase universal
intelligence through raw power.</p>

<p>As a sandwich-eating universal intelligence, I’m not convinced.
Humans got smarter not by growing our brains, but by distributing memory
across society—spoken word, libraries, the internet—finding ways to
preserve and share knowledge without a ruinous overhead. I’ll bet on a
resurgence of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01201">recurrent
approaches</a> that drastically reduce inference costs by maintaining a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769">rolling hidden state,
incrementally processing new information, thinking slowly and deeply
when we need them to</a>. Yes, we might need specialized modules for
robust memory access—but if biology, evolution, and a good pen-and-paper
can do it, so can we. Generality doesn’t require industrial-scale
cooling towers and power plants. It just needs a reliable way to
remember and recall what you’ve thought.</p>
